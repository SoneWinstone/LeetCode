/** 476. Number Complement
 * Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
 * Note:
 * The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.
 * 此答案不是自己想出来的！！！
